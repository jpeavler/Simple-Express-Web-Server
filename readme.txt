My first attempt of using the Express package to make
a simple and local Express Web Server


Stretch Your Thoughts: answer the following questions: 

 What else can you do with Node Packages?
    Change the visual appearance of terminal output. Expand javascript
    in every direction.
 What else can you do with Express? 
    Create an application skeleton.
 What other technologies could you use instead of Express?
    Koa, React, Flask, Django, Go, nginx, Laravel and hapi.
 How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before?
    I don't have to rely on Visual Studio Code's extention.
    It is a bit more technical and refined.
    I feel that I have a bit more control of how it happens.
